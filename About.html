        I believe in diversification of my skills by taking risks just like grafting which helps in better growth of plants, while it is risky but once successful you get are bound to get awesome results. 
        I believe in figuring out "why" of a problem and finding out solutions to the problem. I want to work on challenges which solve real problems irrespective of the domain.

        <!--Hi,I am pratyush dadhich.  I come from a land of diversity, India which you will see in my skills too.
        I am always into learning new things, and I love to solve problems irrespective of the domain
        (studied a multidisciplinary course, worked on a pharmaceutical challenge, got selected for a
        challenge by a media production group). I want to develop solutions which people didn't think of,
        as people do not know what they need until someone shows them. I aim to become an expert generalist.
        .
        <br />When I am not doing technical stuff I am found cooking, playing basketball, reading or just exploring internet.
        <br />Currently I am looking for a job and relocating is not a constraint for me.
