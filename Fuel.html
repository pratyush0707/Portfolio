        Fuel is design thinking project developed for multiple sclerosis patients under <a href="https://sugar-network.org/" class="bold" target="_blank">

        Fuel allows patients to utilise their avaialble energy in the best way possible.
        It was a challenging project for
        us as we didn't had medical background but we as a team accomplished the success in the end.

        <div class="because"> because MS fatigue is different and unpredicatable with no assistance available </div>

        <div class="fuel-heading">How do we measure Fatigue?</div>
        <div>
            By measurinng 5 physiological parameters, which we found from research papers in the field, then training an algorithm to recognise the pattern between these parameters
            and fatigue, we can predict when users will feel fatigued and therefore allowing them to utilise the energy in the activities they want.

            <div class="fuel-heading">What we developed?</div>
            After developing several prototypes and feedbacks from users we came with Fuel, which we started with
            training the algorithm by collecting data from 30 patients over a month through an app and using a smartwatch.
