# Portfolio
Bored with the old portfolio pdfs 
Hello Myself Pratyush Dadhich, a guy who wants to try different things with the new technologies available and so this project is to develop my portfolio 
in a webGL format, here you can interact with the products and see the details in depth and therefore it provides a better experience then other form of portfolios.
